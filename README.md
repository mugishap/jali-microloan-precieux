## API Documentation

This project includes a Swagger UI for testing and viewing the API endpoints. Swagger provides a user-friendly interface to interact with the API, making it easier to test and understand the available endpoints.

### Accessing Swagger UI

1. **Start the Application**: Ensure your application is running. You can start it using the following command:
   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```

2. **Open Swagger UI**: Once the application is running, open your web browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:<port>/api
   ```
   Replace `<port>` with the port number your application is running on (usually 3000).

3. **Explore the Endpoints**: Use the Swagger UI to explore and test the available endpoints. You can view detailed information about each endpoint, including the request parameters, response formats, and example requests.

### Benefits of Using Swagger

- **Interactive Testing**: Test endpoints directly from the browser without needing additional tools.
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: View detailed documentation for each endpoint, including descriptions, parameters, and response types.
- **Ease of Use**: Swagger's intuitive interface makes it easy to understand and interact with the API.

For more information on how to use Swagger, refer to the [Swagger documentation](https://swagger.io/docs/).
